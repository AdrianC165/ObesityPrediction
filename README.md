# ObesityPrediction
Exploring the Link Between Eating Habits and Obesity

## Project Overview
In this project, we’re digging into the relationship between eating habits and obesity using machine learning. The dataset comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). The main goal is to clean up the data, build a regression model, and see how well we can predict obesity levels based on various lifestyle factors.

## Dataset
We're using the "ObesityDataSet_raw_and_data_sinthetic.csv" from the UCI ML Repository. You can grab it from the link below and place it in the same folder as the code before running the project:
- [Download the Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Obesity+Level+Prediction)

**Important**: Be sure to download the dataset directly and avoid including it in your submission.

## Required Libraries
You’ll need the following Python libraries to get everything running:
- `pandas` (for data handling)
- `numpy` (for numerical operations)
- `scikit-learn` (for the machine learning model)
- `matplotlib` (for plotting)

You can install everything in one go with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
