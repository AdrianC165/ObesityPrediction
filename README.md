# ObesityPrediction
Exploring the Link Between Eating Habits and Obesity

## Project Overview
In this project, we’re digging into the relationship between eating habits and obesity using machine learning. The dataset comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). The main goal is to clean up the data, build a regression model, and see how well we can predict obesity levels based on various lifestyle factors.

## Dataset
We're using the "ObesityDataSet_raw_and_data_sinthetic.csv" from the UCI ML Repository. You can grab it from the link below and place it in the same folder as the code before running the project:
- [Download the Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Obesity+Level+Prediction)

**Important**: Be sure to download the dataset directly and avoid including it in your submission.

## Required Libraries
You’ll need the following Python libraries to get everything running:
- `pandas` (for data handling)
- `numpy` (for numerical operations)
- `scikit-learn` (for the machine learning model)
- `matplotlib` (for plotting)

You can install everything in one go with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

## Running the Code
Once you have the dataset and libraries set up, you’re ready to run the code. Simply execute the Python script, and it will handle the rest, including data preprocessing, training the model, and generating evaluation metrics.

Make sure to save the dataset in the same directory as the script, or adjust the file path accordingly (just don’t hardcode any local paths).

To run the code, use:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
